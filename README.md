# Exploit Protection policy for Windows 10 1809+ systems

This repository contains a custom Exploit Protection policy, that should not interfere with most popular apps and day-to-day tasks.

The policy is a mix of several policies (+ custom modifications):
- DISA STIG Exploit Protection v3 (part of the [Windows 10 package](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/stigs/zip/U_MS_Windows_10_V2R4_STIG.zip))
- Microsoft Secure Baseline Exploit Protection policy for 1809 systems (has been removed from later baselines for [compatiblity reasons](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/security-baseline-final-for-windows-10-v1909-and-windows-server/ba-p/1023093))
- milgradesec's [awesome Exploit Protection policy](https://github.com/milgradesec/windows-settings/blob/main/ExploitGuard/ExploitSettings.xml)
